Gagarin is simple frontend template based on SASS, Jade and Gulp with Twitter Bootstrap grid system. Poyekhali!

#### Oh, yes, I wrote my own frontend framework

This development has two objectives - to develop my own template for a quick start of new project. The second goal - practice with Github and with ancillary services and technologies. I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was lagging behind many developers.
