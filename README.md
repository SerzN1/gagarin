Gagarin is frontend template based on PostCSS, Jade and Gulp with Bootstrap grid system. 

**Poyekhali!**

#### Oh, yes, I wrote my own frontend framework

<img width="120" height="120" align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonick/gagarin/master/src/i/frontend_technologies.gif" title="Modern frontend developer">

This development has two objectives – to develop my own template for a quick start of new project.
The second goal – practice with Github and with ancillary services and technologies.
I want to understand the most advanced frontend technology, because it seems to me that I was lagging behind many developers.
